Digitally Analyzing the Uneven Ground: Language Borrowing in Indian Treaties
How smooth must be the language of the whites, when they can make right look like wrong, and wrong like right.
--Blackhawk
	Word choice and the functioning of language itself has become an important sub-field within indigenous history. As Patricia Limerick has noted, “the process of invasion, conquest, and colonization was the kind of activity that provoked a shiftiness in verbal behavior.”  As Blackhawk’s quote demonstrates, modern scholars were not the first individuals to recognize words as tools of settler colonialism. Jean M. O’Brien’s Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians Out of Existence in New England and James Joseph Buss’ Winning the West with Words: Language and Conquest in the Lower Great Lakes demonstrate how non-indigenous authors, politicians, and historians used language to exterminate Indians in the collective American consciousness even if they failed to do so in reality. Still, the written words that most impact the lives of Native Americans are contained within treaties. 
	Numerous scholars including David Wilkins, Vine Deloria, Jr., and K. Tsianina Lomawaima have examined the importance of treaties to federal Indian policy. Other scholars such as Chantal Norrgard, Patricia Pierce Erikson, and Jean Dennison have focused on the impact of specific treaties on particular nations. These analyses trace the implications of words to the critical issues of tribal sovereignty and fishing, whaling, hunting, mineral, and gathering rights. Despite the flourishing of this New Tribal History, the examination of treaties as a single corpus has yet to be undertaken. This essay explores the content and connections between treaties using the methods of digital history. It argues that treaty authors frequently borrowed both content and language from previous documents but only rarely did this borrowing occur over long periods of time or across geographic regions. Most treaties borrowed from their immediate temporal predecessors and geographic neighbors.
1. Research questions and methodology
	This research project was framed around several specific questions: 
•	To what extent did treaties adhere to a standard structure or form?
•	Were there specific treaties that subsequent authors and negotiators modeled their agreements after in terms of language? 
•	If borrowing did occur, what portions of previous treaties did authors or negotiators borrow and why?
•	How did time and geography influence the content and language of treaties? 
As with any historical research project, I chose the methods and theoretical frameworks for their ability to answer and/or explore these aforementioned research questions. Central to answering these questions is the method of digitally detecting text reuse or borrowing. In many ways this approach works similarly to plagiarism detection software in that a computer program scans a series of documents and calculates the similarity between them. In this case, the computer is not identifying plagiarism but language borrowing. This is not the first study to employ such an approach. Ryan Cordell successfully used the method of digitally detecting text reuse to trace the reprinting and circulation of articles by a network of 19th century newspapers. Kellen Funk and Lincoln Mullen also used this approach to trace the state to state borrowing of legal code within American law. It is from this latter study that this essay draws most of its methodology.
	To acquire the text of the treaties in digital format, I scraped from Oklahoma State’s Kappler Project website, where they host the 388 digital transcriptions of the treaties contained in Charles J. Kappler’s Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties. This approach negated the issue that many digital history projects have concerning the quality of Optical Character Recognition (turning scanned images into digital text) because the online text was manually transcribed. After acquiring the treaties, I massaged them into a format conducive to answering the research questions and compatible with R, the programming software that was used to analyze the texts. 
	In order to compute similarity scores that went beyond a document to document comparison, I split the body of the treaties apart and turned them into their own separate files. This approach allowed for a paragraph to paragraph computation of similarity and allowed for the documents to be visually displayed in a network graph both at the document and paragraph level.
	Using Lincoln Mullen’s "textreuse: Detect Text Reuse and Document Similarity" package for R, I computed the similarity of the documents and turned the results into the visualizations that appear in this essay. In addition to the network graphs, I also clustered the documents using affinity propagation clustering in order to identify clusters of closely related texts. This process helped detect groups of texts that borrowed from the same “exemplar” document. The findings, questions, and anomalies that this process raised will be addressed in the second and third sections of this essay.
2. A macro view of the uneven ground
In their study of Indian sovereignty and American law, David Watkins and K. Tsianina Lomawaima describe federal Indian policy as an “uneven ground” characterized by “inconstancy, indeterminacy, and variability” (6). They observed that “Indian policy has not proceeded along some smooth racetrack, but has pitched and bumped over the rutted tracks that the conflicting interests of tribes, states, federal agencies, railroads, energy and industrial barons, homesteaders, tourists, and casual visitors have carved across Indian Country” (6). This section examines just one layer of this uneven ground, Indian treaties. 
From a macro perspective, the nearly 400 different Indian treaties of the uneven ground share many commonalities. In addition to their shared content (land, gifts, payments, protections, trade), they generally followed similar language borrowing patterns. While text reuse is only one indicator of the connections and influences previous treaties had upon subsequent agreements, it is particularly useful in this case. Given the extent to which most treaties contained a narrow set of topics, it can be difficult to say with any certainty which treaties served as templates or models for other treaties (and to a certain extent they all did). The benefit of using digital methods to detect text reuse is that it can identify language pattern similarities that would be nearly impossible to detect using close reading. Thus, it is possible to see what early 19th century treaty someone used as a template in the 1850s. For example, the following two paragraphs are matches returned by the computer program. The first text below is taken from an 1804 treaty with the Sauk and Foxes (sau0074-00011). The second text is taken from an 1853 treaty with the Umpqua Cow Creek Band (ump0606-00012 ). 
“Lest the friendship which is now established between the United States and the said Indian tribes should be interrupted by the misconduct of individuals, it is hereby agreed that for injuries done by individuals no private revenge or retaliation shall take place, but, instead thereof, complaints shall be made by the party injured to the other—by the said tribes or either of them to the superintendent of Indian affairs or one of his deputies, and by the superintendent or other person appointed by the President, to the chiefs of the said tribes. And it shall be the duty of the said chiefs upon complaint being made as aforesaid to deliver up the person or persons against whom the complaint is made, to the end that he or they  may be punished agreeably to the laws of the state or territory where the offence may have been committed; and in like manner if any robbery, violence or murder shall be committed on any Indian or Indians belonging to the said tribes or either of them,  the person or persons so offending shall be tried, and if found guilty, punished in the like manner as if the injury had been  done to a white man. And it is further agreed, that the chiefs of the said tribes shall, to the utmost of their power exert themselves to recover horses or other property which may be stolen from any citizen or citizens of the United States by any individual or individuals of their tribes….”
“That the friendship which is now established between the United States and the Cow Creek band of Indians, shall not be interrupted  by the misconduct of individuals, it is hereby agreed that for injuries done, no private revenge or retaliation shall take place; but instead thereof complaint shall be made by the party injured to the Indian  agent; and it shall be the duty of the chiefs of said band of Indians, upon complaint being made as aforesaid, to deliver up the person against whom the complaint is made, to the end that he may be punished, agreeably to the laws of the United States; and in like manner if any violation, robbery, or murder shall be committed on any Indian belonging to said band, the person so offending shall be tried, and if found guilty, shall be punished according to the laws of the United States. And it is further agreed that the chiefs shall, to the utmost of their ability, exert themselves to recover horses or other property   which has or may hereafter be stolen from any citizen of the United States, by any individual of said tribe….”
The latter treaty clearly used the former as a template for the structure and content of the treaty. As can be seen some updates were made to the 1853 treaty as, “punished in the like manner as if the injury had been done to a white man” became “be punished according to the laws of the United States.” This type of borrowing occurred frequently and it followed a strong trend. 
	In most cases, treaties only borrowed from their immediate temporal predecessors and geographic neighbors. Very rarely did this borrowing occur over long periods of time or across geographic regions. The histogram below charts the time span of treaty borrowing. For example, if a paragraph from treaty_a was written in 1848 and a paragraph from treaty_b was written in 1855 then the span is 7 years. 
HISTOGRAM
The vast majority (89%) of the treaty borrowing occurred within a two year span. This number is slightly skewed due to the fact that commissioners often composed, within a few days or months, a cluster of treaties dealing with a group of nations or bands. For example, Brigadier-general Henry Atkinson and Indian agent Major Benjamin O'Fallon composed several treaties in 1825 with the Arikara, Makah, Belantse-Etoa (Minitaree), Cheyenne, Crow, Ponca, Pawnee, and Mandan nations in addition to agreements with several bands of the Sioux. All of these treaties were composed within a few months and share over a dozen paragraphs. The text reuse detection model still including these treaties as examples of borrowing. While this cluster of treaties does not indicate what texts Atkinson and O’Fallen used as models, it does highlight another general characteristic of Indian treaties, contextual composition. 
Rather than having a governmentally mandated master document detailing the necessary form and content of a treaty, the commissioners molded treaties to correspond to the unique situational circumstances of the uneven ground.  The following network graph displays the borrowing that occurred between treaties. The width or thickness of the connection edges or lines is a summation of the total number of paragraphs shared between two treaties. 
NETWORK GRAPH
As the network graph indicates, there was very limited borrowing across time. Most of these clusters of treaties contain only one or two colors (corresponding to decades). Also visible are several isolated clusters of treaties that represent the practice of treaty borrowing mentioned above where a commissioner composed several treaties within a short span of time. For example, the following network graph shows the borrowing between the different treaties negotiated with the Sioux bands in 1865
Sioux_1865
This commissioner specific language also limited borrowing geographically as the commissioners rarely veered from their groove in the uneven ground. Most often treaties borrowed from their geographic neighbors or from previous agreements with the same nation(s). There are only a few examples of treaties that borrowed language from agreements in different geographical regions (see section 3).

3. A micro view of selected examples
While the general trend for language borrowing among treaties was limited by time and geography, there were some exceptions to this rule. 
The following two texts are matches identified by the computer program. The first is text taken from the 1789 Treaty of Fort Harmar signed in present day Ohio with several different Indian nations. The second text from an 1846 treaty negotiated with the Comanche.  wya0018-00011
“It is agreed that if any Indian or Indians of the nations before mentioned, shall commit a murder or robbery on any of the citizens of the United States, the nation or tribe to which the offender belongs,          on complaint being made, shall deliver up the person or persons complained of, at the nearest post of the United States; to  the end that he or they may be tried, and if found guilty, punished according to the laws established in the territory of  the United States north-west of the river Ohio, for the punishment of such offences, if the same shall have been committed within the said territory; or according to the laws of the State where the offence may have been committed, if the same has          happened in any of the United States. In like manner, if any subject or citizen of the United States shall commit murder or robbery on any Indian or”       
“It is agreed that, if any Indians shall commit a murder or robbery on any citizen of the United States, the tribe or nation to which the offender belongs shall deliver up the person or persons so complained of, on complaint being made to their chief, to the nearest post of the United States, to the end that he or they may be tried, and, if found guilty, punished, according to the law of the State or Territory where such offence may have been committed. In like manner, if any subject or citizen of the United States shall commit murder or robbery on any Indian or Indians of the said tribes or nations, upon complaint thereof to the agent residing near them, he or they shall be arrested, tried, and punished according to the law of the State or Territory where such offence may have been committed.”
The latter text obviously borrowed the language from the treaty written 57 years before. While the time span between this
